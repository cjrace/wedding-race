      <Title order={2}>How do I RSVP?</Title>
      <Text>
        An RSVP section will be added to the website once accommodation booking
        opens (expected November 2025). There you&apos;ll be able to RSVP and
        share dietary requirements.

        Can I still come to the pre-wedding festivities if not staying on site?
      </Title>
      <Text>
        Yes, we would love to see you there! You&apos;ll just need to leave by
        10pm as the venue requests that only guests staying on site remain after this
        time.

      <Title order={2}>Can I bring fireworks?</Title>
      <Text>
        Unfortunately not, as the venue is very close to local farms and wildlife.

      <Title order={2}>Can I bring my dog?</Title>
      <Text>
        We are very sad to say that dogs aren&apos;t allowed in the wedding village.

      <Title order={2}>Can I bring my chidren?</Title>
      <Text>
        You can, this is completely up to you. We&apos;re expecting at least a 
        couple of small children at the wedding so you won&apos;t be alone, 
        though we also know some couples will be intentionally using
        the wedding as an excuse to escape!
      </Text>

      <Text>  
       If you are bringing children, please let us know when you RSVP so we
       can make sure we have everything prepared so they can have a great time too!

        Do I need to bring any food or drink with me for the evening before?
      </Title>
      <Text>
        We will be providing food and drink so there&apos;s no need to bring
        anything, though if you would like to bring your own that&apos;s fine
        too!
      </Text>
      <Text>
        There are bottle fridges available at the village to store drinks and
        we&apos;ll have pizza ovens running, so feel free to get creative if you do
        bring anything along!

      <Title order={2}>
        I&apos;ll be there the evening before, do I need to join in for
        everything or is it okay if I just chill in my pod?
      </Title>
      <Text>
        Completely up to you! We want you to feel comfortable and enjoy your
        stay so you join in for as much or as little as you like. The pods are
        all yours from the moment you check in so feel free to relax and enjoy
        quiet time in them too!

        I can&apos;t get there until late in the evening for the day before, is that
        okay?
      </Title>
      <Text>
        Yes, of course! Join from whenever you&apos;re able after 4pm.

        What time should I arrive for the wedding if not staying on site the
        night before?
      </Title>
      <Text>
        Guests will be seated for the ceremony at 12:45, so please just make
        sure you&apos;re ready at the venue before then. If you arrive early 
        there&apos;ll be people around to point you in the right direction, 
        and you will be able to wait with other guests in the wedding village.

      <Title order={2}>
        Will there be somewhere for getting ready before the wedding?
      </Title>
      <Text>
        The wedding village pods are spacious enough that getting ready
        shouldn&apos;t be a problem but for something more socialable we have a
        dedicated makeup shack for beautifying yourself with company. For
        bridesmaids we&apos;ll be getting ready in the cottages, which has a
        dedicated room for make up and hair.

      <Title order={2}>What should I wear?</Title>
      <Text>
        Evening before is casual, then fancy it up for our wedding day, most people
        will be wearing the usual wedding garb of suits and fancy dresses. It will
        be summer, so make sure you're comfortable!

      <Text>
        We haven&apos;t finalised colours yet, if you&apos;re worried about colour
        clashing or accidentally matching the bridesmaids just drop us a message!

      <Divider my="md" />
      <Title order={2}>What if I have a dietary restriction?</Title>
      <Text>
        We&apos;ll collect dietary requirements as part
        of your RSVP. We&apos;ll then use this info to make sure we have
        suitable food and drinks for anyone staying in the wedding village the
        night before as well as working with the wedding day caterers to make 
        sure there is food everyone can enjoy on the day itself.

        Can I leave the wedding village during my stay?
      </Title>
      <Text>
        Absolutely, you&apos;re free to come and go as you please (aside from
        being there for ceremony and main celebrations after!). We&apos;ll
        provide maps of the local area so if you want to, you can go for a walk
        or run nearby.
